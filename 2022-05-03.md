## Hello newcomers 🏃

Roles in Discord server is very important. Knowing that, Mochi also cannot 
lack methods to help you manage roles easier than ever.

Just assign your newcomers with default role you want to with `$defaultrole` 
or short-hand `$dr`.

![default-role](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30283022/166453734-873c2e1d-3552-4d95-a3e6-cdfcf56712d4.png)

Or wanna more magic? 👀 We crafted a `$reactionrole` / `$rr` command. Like 
that name, you can add reactions in your message and let's people choose 
whatever role they want. Sound like a ⚔️ *RPG* 🛡️ game huh? Should try 
`$help rr` now 🔥
